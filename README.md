# Nhash

This is a Javascript (Node.js) implementation of the algorithm as published in
[NHash: Randomized N-Gram Hashing for Distributed Generation of Validatable
Unique Study Identifiers in Multicenter
Research](https://asset.jmir.pub/assets/54bd6ada07ad7d6b17514bfb00819d0f.pdf)

## TODO:

This is pretty early. It produces the hash from the paper, but right now it
makes no attempts to validate any of it's inputs the way they describe.

It also needs some serious refactoring.
